Most notably, the research blog of Miriam Julius {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://multimedia-memories.tumblr.com/"}}{\fldrslt http://multimedia-memories.tumblr.com/}}; the research blog of the Materialising Memories team, led by Elise van den Hoven {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.materialisingmemories.com/updates/"}}{\fldrslt http://www.materialisingmemories.com/updates/}}; the research blogs of Cathy Haynes, artist (The Timekeeper Project and Stereochron Island) and the talks of Jason Scott, technology archivist (most notably \'93From COLO to YOLO: Confessions of an angry archivist\'94 at Bacon 2014, in London).}
