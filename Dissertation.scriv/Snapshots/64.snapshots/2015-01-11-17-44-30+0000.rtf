\f0\fs24 \cf0 Nine participants attended the workshop. All of them were final year design students at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, in Dundee.\
Amongst the participants were 3 women and 6 men, ages ranging from 21 to 24. Six were native speakers of English; three were from overseas and had English as a second language. All were raised in a Western culture and their native language reads left-to-right,which ensured consistent results (as we\'92ve seen before, culture and language alters our visual representation of time); but one of the native English speakers has been raised with a bicultural identity and also natively speaks Cantonese, which reads left-to-right horizontally but can also {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6CD6F151-9661-428F-8C6A-2535E7A720FA"}}{\fldrslt be written vertically}}. They are all frequent users of Facebook; while most owned Twitter accounts, few of them actually used it, so the questions focused on Facebook.}
