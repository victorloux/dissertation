\f0\fs24 \cf0 This dissertation is tied to my honours project, that I will introduce in more detail here. As we have seen, there is a need to backup our data from social networks to protect it, if social networks go down, are discontinued or forgotten. \
Several challenges appear there. Applying the \'93large-scale\'94 paradigms of conservation  established in the previous literature review (Loux, 2014) for small-scale, personal archiving is complex, due to the resources and knowledge needed to conserve information over time, so this needs to be as automated and seamless as possible. The experience of retrieval of digital memories, once stored, is the main theme of the next chapter and my main focus as an interaction designer. Many variables encompass this experience: the representation of time, the hierarchisation of memories, the visual presentation, and the feeling of durability of the backup and object containing them.}
