\f0\fs24 \cf0 This part of the dissertation discusses the gap in research that I want to explore, the experience of 
\f1\b retrieval
\f0\b0  of memories. I will try to understand what encompasses this experience: the representation of time and hierarchisation of memories, the presentation, the feeling of durability of the backup, and how to make it enjoyable. \
This dissertation is tied to my honours project, so I will go over aspects of the project: applying the \'93large-scale\'94 paradigms of conservation  established in the previous chapter for small-scale, personal archiving; the representation/visualisation of memories; how to go against the obsolescence of the object by using open design; and the relationship with families and death.}
