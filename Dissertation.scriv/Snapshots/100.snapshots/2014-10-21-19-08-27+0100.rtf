\f0\fs24 \cf0 Migration is the transformation of a document\'92s content to a format that is not necessarily standardised, but at least current; or, the newer version of same format. This could be, for example, transferring documents from the WordPerfect 6 format (used in the 80s and late 90s) to a Word 2011 format, or a Word 98 file to Word 2011. This should be done regularly, as after a certain period of time new programs will stop having backward compatibility to import these old formats (Thibodeau, 2002). This method has several downsides, mainly being that it is labour intensive and expensive (Thibodeau, 2002; Rothenberg, 1999); product lines, and therefore the migration path, could be terminated at any point (Thibodeau, 2002); the presentation and other characteristics could be changed (although this can be overcome by migrating to more flexible formats like PDF or LaTeX). Rothenberg (1999) adds that this method is also prone to error, risky (as it could compromise the integrity of the data), not scalable and it requires new solutions for each new format. Granger (2000) argues however that comparatively, other methods (particularly emulation) are potentially much more expensive and labour intensive, and that for most preservation programmes, migration remains the only viable method.\
