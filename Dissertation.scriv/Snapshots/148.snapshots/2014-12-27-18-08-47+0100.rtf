\f0\fs24 \cf0 \cb2 Sometimes it\'92s not just a straight line. We can often find that famous Egyptian symbol, the Ouroboros, a snake or a dragon eating its tail, to represent the fact that time can be thought of as a recurring cycle, instead of something linear, with a start and with an end. Today we mostly use this representation for the dial of a clock, because days are easy to visualise as something that repeat themselves. And it\'92s perfectly natural; the Earth rotates continuously around the Earth, that representation actually comes from sundials. [It\'92s interesting because we don\'92t do the same thing when we pick up a calendar \'97 personally when I think of the months, I have a straight line going from January to December but it\'92s not a circle even though it\'92s recurring.]\
What\'92s interesting about this idea, it\'92s that Mayan and Pagan traditions visualised history and life as something like that. For life, they didn\'92t see birth as a new start and death as an end, just something that kept going. [If that helps with the concept, in the Balinese language, the word for grandparent and grandchildren is the same (kumpi). They see lives as continuations of someone else\'92s.]}
