\f0\fs24 \cf0 [Fig. Timelines/Ouroboros]\
This linear timeline, however, is not the only way of representing time; it can also be seen as a recurring cycle. On our day-to-day life, we mostly use this representation for analog clock dials; this is borrowed from sundials, and makes sense when we think of the rotation of the Earth. It really is a continuous cycle, which doesn\'92t really start nor end happening, but that we can still quantify \'97 a day has passed when a full rotation has been done, and we can map time units to it, from midnight to 11:59pm. This representation, however, is rarely used nowadays when talking about months or years, even though the same astronomical principles apply. Would it however be relevant for representing history, or individual lives?\
In many traditions (Mayan and Pagan, for example), lives were seen as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://BE9DBF40-A292-40C3-9EFA-8A6DF8BE5F86"}}{\fldrslt continuation of someone else\'92s life}}; birth wasn\'92t seen as a starting point, and death not as an end point, but it was rather a recurring cycle. Graphically, these lives could be represented as an ouroboros.}
