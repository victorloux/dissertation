\f0\fs24 \cf0 In preparation of future data losses, perhaps, the US Library of Congress maintains a permanent archive of Twitter since 2010 (LoC, 2010). However, this is again kept with a cultural intention: \'93The public Twitter stream is of historical cultural significance and is an amazing repository of mundane moments in the daily lives of many people and records of what they thought important\'94 (Baym, 2010). Scott (2009) has noted the cultural value of archiving GeoCities, despite its tacky design and content; I believe that the jargon, hashtags and emojis of the present day could become the \'91Under Construction\'92 GIFs of the next decade, becoming relics and symbols of a time on the Internet. However, there seems to be little possibility for individuals to create archives of their own account, for retrieving their memories at a later time and not in a general, sociological or historical goal. A few services, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://07EC9ECE-10DA-41DA-A6DB-07B1A1C2B6F7"}}{\fldrslt SocialSafe}} or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://6C4983ED-7BEA-451B-814F-783BCFA707D2"}}{\fldrslt Frostbox}} offer to back up social media accounts; they are principally {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://79F276CF-A3B3-4177-BE94-64C470B32F37"}}{\fldrslt marketed towards businesses and authorities}}, but can also be used by individuals. However these services are subscription-based (or offer subscription-based premiums, but back up using proprietary archive formats) and as such we are simply repeating the situation of social networking sites, where backed up data could disappear if the companies go out of business \'97 possibly in a worse way, since these companies do not have the financial means of social networks to survive for very long.}
