\f0\fs24 \cf0 The workshop started with a short introduction to my project, so that participants understood what are my motivations and what I wanted to get from them. I have presented the topic of my dissertation and honours project, explained the challenges in visually mapping a life, and did a short lecture on time visualisation, summarising what I have discussed in the previous chapter \'97 the cultural differences in time representations, the normalisation of timelines, and the issues with linear timelines for time representation. The slides and notes from the lecture are available in [appendix ??].\
The participants were then asked to perform four tasks: draw their life in a non-linear way, retrieve old photographs on Facebook, answer a survey and evaluate different cartographies of time.}
