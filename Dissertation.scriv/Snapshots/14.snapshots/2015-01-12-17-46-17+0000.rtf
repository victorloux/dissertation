\f0\fs24 \cf0 This dissertation has explored different aspects of the preservation of digital artefacts, the issues with preservation of personal memories from social networks, and, in the context of interaction design, looked at potential methods for the retrieval of these memories in large archives, notably by delving into a variety of representations of time through history and analysing the results of a workshop to understand users\'92 responses.\
By dissecting how the timeline used by social networks works, I have attempted to expose the fact that as a tool that attempts to be neutral and unopinionated, it is ultimately a deceptive and inefficient way of organising items once the amount of information is large enough. For interaction design, it is a challenge to organise information in a manner that is pertinent for users, and looking at alternative ways of representing time was important to be able to design an efficient system to retrieve memories from an archive. The workshop I have held also allowed me to obtain great insights from the potential users\'92 perspective, and what are important factors and concepts to think about when designing such a system: the need for different filters when looking up in an archive, when simply increasing the granularity is not sufficient to help finding something with the information we remember; the importance of careful design in terms of readability and separation, to allow complexity while retaining the user; the general use of periods and events as main reference points when asking people to visually describe their life, rather than time units such as years or months.\
The research presented here is a stepping stone for my honours project, and the observations made here will allow me to drive the development of new prototypes. However, it is far from being a comprehensive answer to all the questions originally asked. I have only obtained a limited understanding of people\'92s behaviour and attitudes towards the preservation of their online data, and the research done on visual representation is not sufficient to establish strong design guidelines for the design of such systems.\
To consolidate the research presented here and help in fully answering the questions asked, further research will be needed. Building prototypes and testing them with users, which is what I set out to do when originally planning this dissertation, actually requires a good understanding of the existing representations of time in the first place. I will now be able to do this with my honours project, but a more complete study with a wider variety of interface paradigms, as part of a MSc or PhD research, would reveal new insights. It would also be necessary to go further in depth when attempting to understand the processes used by users when retrieving old memories on social networks, using ethnographic observation with a careful ethical consideration, and a larger pool of participants.\
This area of study is complex, because it has a \'93futuristic\'94 aspect to it: the full potential of a retrieval system would only be achieved once several decades of data have been accumulated, which has not happened yet since all the social networking sites are still relatively young. However, I am hoping that small pieces of research and experimentation such as this one will pave the way for larger projects in this field, so that powerful, user-friendly systems can be built to preserve emotionally important content before it disappears, and allow new experiences for exploring and recovering it.}
