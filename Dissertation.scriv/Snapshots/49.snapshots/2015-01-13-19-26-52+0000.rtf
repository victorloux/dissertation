\f0\fs24 \cf0 One of the greatest challenges in designing such a system is to make an object that is sustainable, and that can last for several decades. It should be possible to upgrade and renew the item without any loss to the content; as recommended by Richard Banks to me, use strong technology (looking at embedded systems, and components with no moving parts such as solid state drives), and consider open sourced design and software, by openly releasing the plans and code for accessing the data externally, so that it can be used and maintained even if the manufacturing organisation disappears after several years or decades.}
