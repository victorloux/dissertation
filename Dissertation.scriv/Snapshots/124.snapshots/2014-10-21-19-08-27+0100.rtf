\f0\fs24 \cf0 Richard Banks, a researcher at Microsoft Cambridge, suggests that we first preserve artefacts for ourselves. The majority of the time, we simply keep what we consider significant to remind ourselves of particular people, events and places, and to share them with people we care about; we discard what is not meaningful to us by pragmatism (lack of physical space, lack of importance, redundancy) (Banks, 2011, p. 6). This selection process contributes to keeping what we want to remember, and what is the legacy we will want to leave to others after our deaths.\
\
However, the digital age changes this situation. First, the space to store our objects on computers and online is becoming virtually unlimited, and so we tend to accumulate data instead of selecting (Banks, 2011); second, the abundance of online services makes it harder to keep track of everything we create.}
