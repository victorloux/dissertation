\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this task participants to go on their Facebook account, using either their laptop, tablet or mobile phone, and retrieve 3 pictures that made them smile, or that stuck in their mind for any particular reason. The main rule was that this picture had to be 
\f1\b at least one year old
\f0\b0  (by the time of the workshop, this meant posted before December 2013). It did not matter whether the picture was on their own profile, on a friend\'92s profile, on a community page, or on a group. They did not have to be photos on which the participants or their friends were; funny pictures or memes that particularly stuck in their mind would have been fine too. \
The objective of this exercise was to get an understanding of the mental process they go through and how they proceed to find what they want, when they are looking to retrieve old content on Facebook. For each of the three photographs they were asked to describe which method they used to fetch it, how easy for them it was to find it, and if they found it at all (in cases where the picture was not where the user originally thought it was, or if the picture was deleted, or if the account holder deactivated his account).}
