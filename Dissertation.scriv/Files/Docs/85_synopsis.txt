ven if storage media could survive decades or even centuries, technological change means we will not necessarily have the means to access the data later. In other words, “to retain appropriate access to a digital object, we must maintain a mechanism to derive meaning from that object” (del Pozo et al., 2012, p6): for optical media, this includes not only the drives to read the disc, but also a cable to connect the drive to the computer’s motherboard, a motherboard that has a connector for this type of cable, and an operating system that has drivers for this connectivity (Pearson 2009, slide 11). Once we have access to the bitstream from the computer we need to be able to represent it, which means we also need to keep the software in a version that can open the preserved file. There is a myth, kept by both customers and vendors, that media is long-lived: “[An IT vendor] offered us a special polymer that they guaranteed would preserve a CD-ROM for 100 years. They were unable to answer how we would preserve a CD-ROM player for that length of time.” (Weathley, 2003, cited by Harvey, 2012, p. 37)
