Hangal et al. (2011) have developed MUSE (Memories USing Email), a system finding patterns in email archives to help us make sense of this large data set. As the authors note in the introduction, “email has become a de facto medium of record; many people consciously deposit important information into email, knowing they can look it up later”, and so our inboxes contain highly valuable in- formation.Early users reported that they have been using it to: make a summary of their work progress; extract and organise certain type of data (for instance, the personal out of the professional, or the important out of the more mundane); finding life milestones inside family emails; picking up work that has been left unfinished and forgotten; or renewing with old relationships. These uses went beyond the authors’ original expectations of simply reminiscing:“The stories above include an example of each one of the ‘5R’s’ described by Sellen and Whittaker [2010]: recollection, reminiscing, retrieving, reflecting, and remembering in- tentions. Further, it suggests that browsing and remembering the past can affect the fu- ture.” (Hangal et al., 2011)
