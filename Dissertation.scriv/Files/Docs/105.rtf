\f0\fs24 \cf0 Digital artifacts have certain fundamental advantages over physical objects: the main two being the ease of organising a collection of data through indexing, cataloguing and adding metadata (Kirk and Sellen, 2010, p. 35), and the ability to duplicate and share that object accurately and virtually cost- free (Banks, 2011).
