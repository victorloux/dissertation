\f0\fs24 \cf0 This varies highly with the type of medium used and with the storage conditions; for example, samples by the Digital Preservation Coalition (2008, p. 154) show that D3 cartridge tapes deteriorates after 50 years in optimal conditions (25% RH at 10\'ba) but only one year in high humidity and temperatures (50%RH at 28\'ba). Similar results happen for the more commercially available optical media (down to three months and up to a theoretical 200 years), which are more sensitive to moisture (Harvey, 2012, p.47).\
