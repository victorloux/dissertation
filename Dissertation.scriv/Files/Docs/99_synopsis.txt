Standardisation is the transformation of a document’s content to a format that is standardised, open and well documented, ensuring that we will be able to open it with a variety of applications on a variety of platforms and that we can rebuild a program for visualising that document — as opposed to vendor-specific, closed source program that could be discontinued at any point in the future. Rothenberg (1999, p. 10)
