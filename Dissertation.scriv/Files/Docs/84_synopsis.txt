Harvey (1993, pp.14,140), and Bastian, Cloonan and Harvey (2011, pp.612â€“613)), this cannot be applied to digital storage media because their lifetime is much shorter. This varies highly with the type of medium used and with the storage conditions; for example, samples by the Digital Preservation Coalition (2008, p. 154) show that D3 cartridge tapes deteriorates after 50 years in optimal conditions (25% RH at 10o) but only one year in high humidity and temperatures (50%RH at 28o). Similar results happen for the more commercially available optical media (down to three months and up to 200 years), which are more sensitive to moisture (Harvey, 2012, p.47).
