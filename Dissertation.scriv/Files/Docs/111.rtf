\f0\fs24 \cf0 Poor preservation documentation and metadata means it could be hard for potential users to find the data (UNESCO 2003). \'93Critical aspects of functionality, such as formatting of documents or the rules by which databases operate, may not be recognised and may be discarded or damaged in preservation processing.\'94 (UNESCO 2003)\
