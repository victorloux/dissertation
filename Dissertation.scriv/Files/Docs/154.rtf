\f0\fs24 \cf0 As we have seen, the technical complexity of preserving digital information is a problem in itself. But even once we have chosen a suitable preservation scheme, there is another equally important question that must then be raised: how do we organise and retrieve our data? We cannot simply gather all digital items and let them pile up unorganised. In the context of a digital personal life, several artefacts are created daily (social network updates, emails, messages) and after a decade this can build up to tens of thousands of pieces of data, that we will need to go through once we are looking for something.}
