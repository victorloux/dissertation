In order to keep the most valuable content, algorithms could be used. Kawano (2008) proposes to use reputation models, that attempts to determine the relative value of a Web page by considering its \'93importance, fairness, trustiness, uniqueness and valuation\'94. This is done using a variety of ways; the algorithm suggested by Kawano relies on the consistency of a web page, that is the amount of time it existed, the number of links it contains and the number of external links to this page (Kawano, 2008, p. 291).\
