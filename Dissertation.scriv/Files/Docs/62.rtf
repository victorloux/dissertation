\f0\fs24 \cf0 In order to get a better understanding on how we could map a life, I have organised a workshop where I have asked some people to perform a few tasks such as graphically representing their life and retrieving old content on social networks, and answer a few questions about the project. This chapter will detail the methodological approach used to prepare the workshop and questions, then analyse the results and make conclusions on how these results can be used to design a retrieval interface. The raw questions and results are available in the appendices A to E.}
