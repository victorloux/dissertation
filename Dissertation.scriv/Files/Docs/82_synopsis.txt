It is interesting to ask ourselves if the paradigms for digital preservation used by librarians and archivists are still valid for preservation of our personal data. Harvey (2012) and Lukesh (1999, cited in Harvey, 2012, p. 32) note that our personal correspondence and sentimental ar- tefacts stored digitally might be lost if we do not take steps to preserve them, and wonder how we will be able to understand our modern life without these exchanges.
