\f0\fs24 \cf0 Banks (2011) also suggests that we could blend in the physical and the digital to allow recording of things we never had the opportunity to before. He gives as example the Weather Camera, an experimental object by Kjen Wilkens (2011) that records wind and temperature along with commentary, instead of an image, as an alternative to recall a place; or 3D backups by H\'e9ctor Serrano (2009), another experimental project that allows us to make backups of sentimentally important objects through 3D scanning and 3D printing.\
Similarly, Banks notes tools by Microsoft Research to recreate places in a 3D environment based on photos, allowing to recreate a sentimentally important place at any given point in time provided enough photos are available. A similar technique is used in bigger preservation projects, as described by Zhou et al. (2012), to make high quality 3D models of culturally important places and objects in China.\
Kirk and Sellen (2010) found however that ultimately, stories and narrative are more important than the preservation of the artifact itself. They propose that \'93technology might play a role in capturing and associating stories or narratives with different physical objects\'94, imagining that we could augment physical objects with RFID tags (and I would add, virtual reality technologies) to pass down stories attached to these objects.}
