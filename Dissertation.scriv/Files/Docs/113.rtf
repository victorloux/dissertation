There are various controversies around whether we should automate the archiving of the Internet, or if we should operate a manual selection. UNESCO (2003, p. 73) notes that those who value a more comprehensive collection (i.e. archiving \'93all\'94 the Internet) argue that \'93any information may turn out to have long-term value, and that the costs of detailed selection are greater than the costs of collecting and storing everything\'94. This argument is particularly true because of the digital media: \'93unlike non-digital material such as paper-based artifacts, where there is a period of time in which to make selection decisions before deterioration of materials becomes an issue, the time frame for deciding whether or not to preserve digital materials is very short\'94 (Harvey, 2012, p. 57). UNESCO (2003, p.71)backs that claim: \'93it may not be possible to wait for evidence of enduring value to emerge before making selection decisions\'94.\
Other people [Cook?] think that it would be preferable to keep a curated collection because of a higher technical quality, and this also allow us to settle [negotiate?] preservation rights with the content producers. Harvey adds that we also do not have the technical capabilities to find all the pages on the Internet, and even if we had we would not have the technical possibility to store the whole of the Internet (Harvey 2012, p. 58); again, this is also something recognised by UNESCO: \'93\'91there are usually more things \'96 more information, more records, more publications, more data \'96 than we have the means to keep\'94 (2003, p.70).\
The UNESCO (2003) and Cook (2000) both however recognise that a middle ground should be found and that both approaches are valid depending on the goal of the preservation. For instance, the Internet Archive[IA] is going through an automated process (archive as many pages as possible) but, because of technical limitation, only preserves the text and dismisses all other images, stylesheets and external media, which could be critical in some instances. It seems evident that for valued documents these should be retained. The British Library\'92s Web Archive[ukwa] [http://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/]}
