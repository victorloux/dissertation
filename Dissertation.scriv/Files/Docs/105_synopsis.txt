Kirk and Sellen (2010) found however that ultimately, stories and narrative are more impor- tant than the preservation of the artefact itself. They propose that “technology might play a role in capturing and associating stories or narratives with different physical objects”, imagin- ing we could also digitally augment physical objects or places. Banks (2011) gives as example the Weather Camera (Wilkens, 2011), which records wind force and temperature along with commentary; a system of physicals backup of sentimental items by Serrano (2009) using 3D scanning and 3D printing; and tools by Microsoft Research to recreate an environment in 3D just using photos.
