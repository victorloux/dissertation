<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>The research presented in this dissertation stems from observations of the recent shift of many of our communications towards social networking websites. Whilst creating memories (be it photographs, videos, textual stories…) digitally rather than physically is not exactly a new thing, the places where we share them online are progressively going further away from our own control. This creates worrying uncertainty in terms of preservation of our digital legacy.<br/>
Traditionally, we have kept what wa...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The disappearance of constraints</strong><br/>Richard Banks, a researcher at Microsoft Cambridge, suggests that we first preserve artefacts for ourselves. The majority of the time, we simply keep what we consider significant to remind ourselves of particular people, events and places, and to share them with people we care about; we discard what is not meaningful to us by pragmatism (lack of physical space, lack of importance, redundancy) (Banks, 2011, p. 6). This selection process contributes to keeping what we want to remember, and what is...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Collecting a culture</strong><br/>To combat this issue, following the quick shutdown of hosting sites like Geocities, AOL Hometown and Podango, technology historian and web archivist Jason Scott started the Archive Team in 2009 (Scott, 2009). Described as a  “loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage” (The Archive Team, 2014), The Archive Team aggressively downloads whole websites that risk to close down soon, and then mirrors them. Their mission statement ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>For social networks</strong><br/>In preparation of future data losses, perhaps, the US Library of Congress maintains a permanent archive of Twitter since 2010 (LoC, 2010). However, this is again kept with a cultural intention: “The public Twitter stream is of historical cultural significance and is an amazing repository of mundane moments in the daily lives of many people and records of what they thought important” (Baym, 2010). Scott (2009) has noted the cultural value of archiving GeoCities, despite its tacky design and conte...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Digital heritage</strong><br/>A rare exception to this is Digital Heirlooms, a series of prototypes developed by Microsoft Research (Odom et al., 2012) to investigate how digital memories can be passed down and inherited. As the name implies, these conceptual objects were regarded as equivalents to photographic albums and diaries that can be passed down between generations. The three prototypes showed backups of Twitter,  locally-stored photographs, and Flickr [fig. 1.3].<br/>

The testing of these prototypes with users ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Context</strong><br/>This dissertation is tied to my honours project, that I will introduce in more detail here. As we have seen, there is a need to backup our data from social networks to protect it, if social networks go down, are discontinued or forgotten. <br/>
Several challenges appear there. Applying the “large-scale” paradigms of conservation  established in the previous literature review (Loux, 2014) for small-scale, personal archiving is complex, due to the resources and knowledge needed to conserve information ...</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Maintaining context</strong><br/>It is important to add or maintain context with the data (transforming data into information), and not just copy the raw data. Kirk and Sellen (2010) found that ultimately, stories and narrative are more important than the preservation of the artefacts themselves; this is particularly important in the situation of heirlooms, where transmitting the emotional value and stories is more important than a meaningless photograph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sustainable system</strong><br/>One of the greatest challenges in designing such a system is to make an object that is sustainable, and that can last for several decades. It should be possible to upgrade and renew the item without any loss to the content; as recommended by Richard Banks to me, use strong technology (looking at embedded systems, and components with no moving parts such as solid state drives), and consider open sourced design and software, by openly releasing the plans and code for accessing the data externally,...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Reducing abstractions</strong><br/>Storing the data locally, in one’s own home — as opposed to an online service — is fundamental. Not only as a protection against online services shutting down eventually, but also as a reassurance by removing the abstraction that lets us access data, remarked by Banks (2011, p. 27):  “I have no idea what kind of hardware my files are now stored or even where they are geographically. I just expect to have access to them as long as I pay my bills.” Ethnographical research shows that this as a conc...</p>

<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Spatial model of timeline</strong><br/>Time itself is not a concept that can be visualised. Whenever we think about time, we actually transform it into space in order to picture it in our minds. The most natural way, for us, is to visualise an arrow going like the one in [fig. 3.1].<br/>
[fig. 3.1]<br/>
It goes into the realm of space because it is a movement; the past is behind us and goes to the future, ahead of us. This idea of movement is repeated in our everyday language (Weger and Pratt, 2008, p. 426 and Boroditsky, 2010, p. 334); we use...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Cultural differences</strong><br/>For example, Tversky et al. (1991) demonstrated that the origin of the direction can stem in the reading direction. When we read, the upcoming (future) information is on the right; we make progress by going right in a sentence or book. Speakers of languages that are read from right to left actually think of time going from right to left, the opposite direction of how Western European cultures see it, as demonstrated in Tversky et al.’s experiment. In every day life, it is possible to see this di...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Circular representation</strong><br/>This linear timeline, however, is not the only way of representing time; it can also be seen as a recurring cycle. On our day-to-day life, we mostly use this representation for analog clock dials; this is borrowed from sundials, and makes sense when we think of the rotation of the Earth. It really is a continuous cycle, which doesn’t really start nor end happening, but that we can still quantify — a day has passed when a full rotation has been done, and we can map time units to it, from midnight...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Historical timelines</strong><br/>Timelines over history, quick history and particularly go over fact that they are new and they have been normalised on units in mid-18th century</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Process-related</strong><br/>Haynes (2014a) encourages us to stop trying to use units, and points out the works of Sasha Stern and Evans-Pritchard, who respectively analysed the ancient Jews’ and the Nuer’s ways of constructing time in their day-to-day thinking.<br/>
Stern believed that in ancient Judaism, for those speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, “the notion of time as an entity in itself, a human resource, a continuous flow, or a structure of dimension of the created world, [is] simply non-existent” (Stern, 2003, p. 127, cited in...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Applying it to a personal life</strong><br/>Should we think using events more than with units? Timelines and mechanical clocks are devices that have appeared relatively recently, over the course of the 18th century (Haynes, 2013a); yet they have shaped our vision of time to be incredibly linear and normalised. But Joseph Priestley, the inventor of the modern history timeline as we know it, admitted this drawback:<br/>
“Historical narrative is not linear. It moves backward and forward making comparisons and contrasts, and branches irregularly f...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Workshop</strong><br/>In order to get a better understanding on how we could map a life, I have organised a workshop where I have asked some people to perform a few tasks such as graphically representing their life and retrieving old content on social networks, and answer a few questions about the project. This chapter will detail the methodological approach used to prepare the workshop and questions, then analyse the results and make conclusions on how these results can be used to design a retrieval interface.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Procedure followed</strong><br/>The workshop started with a short introduction to my project, so that participants understood what are my motivations and what I wanted to get from them. I have presented the topic of my dissertation and honours project, explained the challenges in visually mapping a life, and did a short lecture on time visualisation, summarising what I have discussed in the previous chapter — the cultural differences in time representations, the normalisation of timelines, and the issues with linear timelines ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Life mapping</strong><br/>In the first activity, participants of the workshop were invited to map their life visually. The full methodology is described in [appendix B], and the description of results are in [appendix C]<br/>
Overall, we can notice that the line remains a mode of representation chosen by most people, even when asked to attempt to go away from it. A lot of people attempted to classify the events in their lives by emotional value, whether positive or negative; those used a single line. Of the people who used mu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Retrieval of memorable content</strong><br/>In this task participants to go on their Facebook account, using either their laptop, tablet or mobile phone, and retrieve 3 pictures that made them smile, or that stuck in their mind for any particular reason. The full methodology and motives for this activity are explained in [appendix D], and a table of the raw results can be read in [appendix E].<br/>
The results of this activity were divided. For two thirds of the pictures, people knew on which profile to look; they associated, in their memory, ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Questionnaire on the usage of social media</strong><br/>The third task was a questionnaire, asking the participants about their use of social media and their opinion of the project. Questions and reasons for using a questionnaire are outlined in [appendix F], and a table with the raw results is situated in [appendix G]. These questions will only be useful for the honours project, so the results will not be analysed in too much depth.<br/>

The usages that were most often rated as important were:<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Evaluation of time cartographies</strong><br/>In the last activity participants were asked to evaluate different representations of time. Methodology is described in [appendix H]; the evaluated images, along with individual comments, are in [appendix I]. A summary of the averages for each result is presented in the table below [fig. 4.1]; full results lie in [appendix J].<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>This dissertation has explored different aspects of the preservation of digital artefacts, the issues with preservation of personal memories from social networks, and, in the context of interaction design, looked at potential methods for the retrieval of these memories in large archives, notably by delving into a variety of representations of time through history and analysing the results of a workshop to understand users’ responses.<br/>
By dissecting how the timeline used by social networks works, ...</p>
