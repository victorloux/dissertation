<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>The research presented in this dissertation stems from observations of the recent shift of many of our communications towards social networking websites. Whilst creating memories (be it photographs, videos, textual stories‚Ä¶) digitally rather than physically is not exactly a new thing, the places where we share them online are progressively going further from our own control. This creates worrying uncertainty in terms of preservation of our digital legacy.<br/>
Traditionally, we have kept what was sen...</p>

Haynes http://astormisblowing.org/2013/10/11/how-do-you-map-a-life/:<br/>
We didn‚Äôt always picture life like this. The ancient Stoic philosophers, for example, saw every individual life as a perfect circle, whether that life lasts 30 or 80 years. The notion that a life‚Äôs worth should be assessed as full or lacking by its abstract quantities would have seemed faulty to them.<br/>
And it surely is faulty. A measurement is only a shadow of the thing. If we mistake the map for the land, the score for the per...</p>
