<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>The research presented in this dissertation stems from observations of the recent shift of many of our communications towards social networking websites. Whilst creating memories (be it photographs, videos, textual stories…) digitally rather than physically is not exactly a new thing, the places where we share them online are progressively going further away from our own control. This creates worrying uncertainty in terms of preservation of our digital legacy.<br/>
Traditionally, we have kept what wa...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The disappearance of constraints</strong><br/>Richard Banks, a researcher at Microsoft Cambridge, suggests that we first preserve artefacts for ourselves. The majority of the time, we simply keep what we consider significant to remind ourselves of particular people, events and places, and to share them with people we care about; we discard what is not meaningful to us by pragmatism (lack of physical space, lack of importance, redundancy) (Banks, 2011, p. 6). This selection process contributes to keeping what we want to remember, and what is...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Collecting a culture</strong><br/>To combat this issue, in 2009, following the quick shutdown of hosting sites like Geocities, AOL Hometown and Podango, technology historian and web archivist Jason Scott started the Archive Team, a “loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage”. The Archive Team aggressively downloads whole websites that risk to close down soon, and then mirrors them. Their mission statement helps us understand why we cannot trust online servi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>For social networks</strong><br/>In preparation of future data losses, perhaps, the US Library of Congress maintains a permanent archive of Twitter since 2010 (LoC, 2010). However, this is again kept with a cultural intention: “The public Twitter stream is of historical cultural significance and is an amazing repository of mundane moments in the daily lives of many people and records of what they thought important” (Baym, 2010). Scott (2009) has noted the cultural value of archiving GeoCities, despite its tacky design and conte...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Digital heritage</strong><br/>A rare exception to this is Digital Heirlooms, a series of prototypes developed by Microsoft Research (Odom et al., 2012) to investigate how digital memories can be passed down and inherited. As the name implies, these conceptual objects were regarded as equivalents to photographic albums and diaries that can be passed down between generations. The three prototypes showed backups of Twitter,  locally-stored photographs, and Flickr [fig. Review/SlideViewer].<br/>
The testing of these prototypes with u...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Context</strong><br/>This part of the dissertation discusses the gap in research that I want to explore, the experience of retrieval of memories. I will try to understand what encompasses this experience: the representation of time and hierarchisation of memories, the presentation, the feeling of durability of the backup, and how to make it enjoyable. <br/>
This dissertation is tied to my honours project, so I will go over aspects of the project: applying the “large-scale” paradigms of conservation  established in the pr...</p>

 ⁃ Can be renewed/upgraded<br/>
 ⁃ Use strong technology (see embedded systems, SSDs with no moving parts) as recommended by R Banks<br/>
 ⁃ open design —  what is the purpose of it, what would happen to your company if such a product launched, who owns what, etc. [Tie in with part on open design in literature review]</p>

 ⁃ Hard to retrieve data on long timelines<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Adding context</strong><br/>Add context to data, not just a representation of the existing data<br/>
 ⁃ Possibly copy experience/UI of the social networks, quote R Banks - experience of person opening up laptop after 10 years and finding everything as is, or creating a Virtual PC from the hard drive of his deceased father. It goes along with the retrieval of the memory<br/>
 ⁃ Hierarchise the data - finding ways to classify data and make more sense out of it - explore complex representations</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Obstacles to digital heritage</strong><br/><br/>
Odom et al., 2012:<br/>
these instances highlighted tensions around integrating social networking content from members within the collective family archive. Participants made key distinctions between the thoughtful recording of one's life believed to be reflected in their ancestors' diaries, and their own practices of posting less mindful social networking content targeted at multiple audiences, often outside of the family.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Literature review: Deconstructing the timeline</strong><br/>Origin of research - small review of what I have found about time representation</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Spatial model of timeline</strong><br/>Time itself is not a concept that can be visualised. Whenever we think about time, we actually transform it into space in order to picture it in our minds. The most natural way, for us, is to visualise an arrow going like the one in fig. Timeline/movement.<br/>
[Fig. Timeline/movement]<br/>
It goes into the realm of space because it is a movement; the past is behind us and goes to the future, ahead of us. This idea of movement is repeated in our everyday language (Weger and Pratt, 2008, p. 426 and Borodit...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Cultural differences</strong><br/>For example, Tversky et al. (1991) demonstrated that the origin of the direction can stem in the reading direction. When we read, the upcoming (future) information is on the right; we make progress by going right in a sentence or book. Speakers of languages that are read from right to left actually think of time going from right to left, the opposite direction of how Western European cultures see it, as demonstrated in Tversky et al.’s experiment. In every day life, it is possible to see this di...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Circular representation</strong><br/>[Fig. Timelines/Ouroboros]<br/>
This linear timeline, however, is not the only way of representing time; it can also be seen as a recurring cycle. On our day-to-day life, we mostly use this representation for analog clock dials; this is borrowed from sundials, and makes sense when we think of the rotation of the Earth. It really is a continuous cycle, which doesn’t really start nor end happening, but that we can still quantify — a day has passed when a full rotation has been done, and we can map time...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Historical timelines</strong><br/>Timelines over history, quick history and particularly go over fact that they are new and they have been normalised on units in mid-18th century</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Process-related</strong><br/>Haynes (2014) encourages us to stop trying to use units, and points out the works of Sasha Stern and Evans-Pritchard, who respectively analysed the ancient Jews’ and the Nuer’s ways of constructing time in their day-to-day thinking.<br/>
Stern believed that in ancient Judaism, for those speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, “the notion of time as an entity in itself, a human resource, a continuous flow, or a structure of dimension of the created world, [is] simply non-existent” (Stern, 2003, p. 127, cited in ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Applying it to a personal life</strong><br/>Should we think using events more than with units? Timelines and mechanical clocks are devices that have appeared relatively recently, over the course of the 18th century (Haynes, 2013a); yet they have shaped our vision of time to be incredibly linear and normalised. But Joseph Priestley, the inventor of the modern history timeline as we know it, admitted this drawback:<br/>
“Historical narrative is not linear. It moves backward and forward making comparisons and contrasts, and branches irregularly f...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>Of all the different models that I have shown here, the critical question is now to figure out which one is more relevant, and works best, for representing a life based on the data available on social networks and, hopefully, change our view of the future. </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Workshop</strong><br/>In order to get a better understanding on how we could map a life, I have organised a workshop where I have asked some people to perform a few tasks such as graphically representing their life and retrieving old content on social networks, and answer a few questions about the project. This chapter will detail the methodological approach used to prepare the workshop and questions, then analyse the results and make conclusions on how these results can be used to design a retrieval interface.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Procedure followed</strong><br/>The workshop started with a short introduction to my project, so that participants understood what are my motivations and what I wanted to get from them. I have presented the topic of my dissertation and honours project, explained the challenges in visually mapping a life, and did a short lecture on time visualisation, summarising what I have discussed in the previous chapter — the cultural differences in time representations, the normalisation of timelines, and the issues with linear timelines ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Analysis</strong><br/>Overall, we can notice that the line remains a mode of representation chosen by most people, even when asked to attempt to go away from it. A lot of people attempted to classify the events in their lives by emotional value, whether positive or negative; those used a single line. Of the people who used multiple lines, forking and merging again, there was a variety of contexts used. Most people considered schools as the main periods in their life, each change of school generally meaning a change i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Results</strong><br/>The detail of results are available in [appendix Q-RETRIEVAL]. The results of this activity were divided. For two thirds of the pictures, people knew on which profile to look; they associated, in their memory, the picture with the person who posted it. In over half of these cases, they knew exactly in which photo album it was (as albums are generally unique per particular event or date, or they were in the special profile/cover pictures album); in the remaining cases, they had to browse through ...</p>

Looking at the individual reviews, it appears clear that simplicity is key. The charts that were considered most relevant for being used as life maps were linear, with little to no branching and separation [fig. 2, 5, 6, 13], contradicting the intuitions that I have had when discussing streams and ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>This dissertation has explored different aspects of the preservation of digital artefacts, the issues with preservation of personal memories from social networks, and, in the context of interaction design, looked at potential methods for the retrieval of these memories in large archives, notably by delving into a variety of representations of time through history and analysing the results of a workshop to understand users’ responses.<br/>
