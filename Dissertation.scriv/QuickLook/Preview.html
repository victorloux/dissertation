<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>The research presented in this dissertation stems from observations of the recent shift of many of our communications towards social networking websites. Whilst creating memories (be it photographs, videos, textual stories…) digitally rather than physically is not exactly a new thing, the places where we share them online are progressively going further away from our own control. This creates worrying uncertainty in terms of preservation of our digital legacy.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Growth of data</strong><br/>The amount of data being produced digitally is growing  exponentially (SINTEF, 2013), and with this growth comes a greater volume of data worth archiving over the long term (Harvey, 2012, p. 33). However, the preservation of digital materials cause much more issues than traditional preservation paradigms; where we can consider that for paper and physical artefacts, “benign neglect may be the best treatment” (derived from Cloonan (1993, p.596), Harvey (1993, pp.14,140), and Bastian, Cloonan and H...</p>

“The widespread shift from writing letters to the use of email has diminished the likelihood that personal correspondence will remain accessible to future historians. Lukesh asked in 1999, ‘Where will our understandings of today and, more critically, the next century be, if this rich source of information is no longer available?’, as scientists, scholars, histo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Reasons for preserving</strong><br/>Richard Banks, a researcher at Microsoft Cambridge, suggests that we first preserve artefacts for ourselves. The majority of the time, we simply keep what we consider significant to remind ourselves of particular people, events and places, and to share them with people we care about; we discard what is not meaningful to us by pragmatism (lack of physical space, lack of importance, redundancy) (Banks, 2011, p. 6). This selection process contributes to keeping what we want to remember, and what is...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Personal archiving</strong><br/><br/>
In The Future of Looking Back, Richard Banks (2011) analyses the reasons that lead us to keep or discard physical objects at home. He argues that while making a selection is a positive thing because it forces us to filter our belongings and focus on what is really meaningful, we also run the risk of ridding ourselves of things that we wish we would have kept in retrospect. He points out that the organisation of digital files make this trickier: because we we can keep pretty much everything on v...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Archive Team</strong><br/>In 2009, following the quick shutdown of hosting sites like AOL Hometown and Podango, technology historian and web archivist Jason Scott started the Archive Team, a “loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage”. The Archive Team aggressively downloads whole websites that risk to close down soon, and then mirrors them (i.e. put a static copy online so that the contents are still accessible). Their mission statement helps us un...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>For social networks</strong><br/>In preparation of future data losses, perhaps, the US Library of Congress maintains a permanent archive of Twitter since 2010 (LoC, 2010). However, this is again kept with a cultural intention: “The public Twitter stream is of historical cultural significance and is an amazing repository of mundane moments in the daily lives of many people and records of what they thought important” (Baym, 2010). Keeping a parallel with the GeoCities archive, I believe that the jargon, hashtags and emojis of the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Digital heritage</strong><br/>A rare exception to this is Digital Heirlooms, a series of conceptual objects developed by Microsoft Research (Odom et al., 2012) to investigate how digital artefacts can be passed down and inherited. <br/>

Memorialization of deceased users through online social network sites makes death and grief hard to avoid [43]. Personal memorials abound that are to some degree publicly accessible online.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Storage media</strong><br/>Harvey (1993, pp.14,140), and Bastian, Cloonan and Harvey (2011, pp.612–613)), this cannot be applied to digital storage media because their lifetime is much shorter. This varies highly with the type of medium used and with the storage conditions; for example, samples by the Digital Preservation Coalition (2008, p. 154) show that D3 cartridge tapes deteriorates after 50 years in optimal conditions (25% RH at 10o) but only one year in high humidity and temperatures (50%RH at 28o). Similar results happen for the more commercially available optical media (down to three months and up to 200 years), which are more sensitive to moisture (Harvey, 2012, p.47).</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Access of media</strong><br/>ven if storage media could survive decades or even centuries, technological change means we will not necessarily have the means to access the data later. In other words, “to retain appropriate access to a digital object, we must maintain a mechanism to derive meaning from that object” (del Pozo et al., 2012, p6): for optical media, this includes not only the drives to read the disc, but also a cable to connect the drive to the computer’s motherboard, a motherboard that has a connector for this type of cable, and an operating system that has drivers for this connectivity (Pearson 2009, slide 11). Once we have access to the bitstream from the computer we need to be able to represent it, which means we also need to keep the software in a version that can open the preserved file. There is a myth, kept by both customers and vendors, that media is long-lived: “[An IT vendor] offered us a special polymer that they guaranteed would preserve a CD-ROM for 100 years. They were unable to answer how we would preserve a CD-ROM player for that length of time.” (Weathley, 2003, cited by Harvey, 2012, p. 37)</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Social networks</strong><br/>The emergence of reliable broadband and smartphones meant that instead of storing things locally, we often compose and publish them directly online, on social networks or in the cloud, with no stable backup of our own.<br/>
 The safety of the content is an issue that’s already been under public spotlight, both in terms of privacy (your content is sometimes publicly accessible) and security (hacking and social engineering[1], governmental surveillance programmes).  What interests me here is the lifesp...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Loss of metadata</strong><br/>Poor preservation documentation and metadata means it could be hard for potential users to find the data (UNESCO 2003). “Critical aspects of functionality, such as formatting of documents or the rules by which databases operate, may not be recognised and may be discarded or damaged in preservation processing.” (UNESCO 2003)<br/>
Poor integrity: “So much contextual information may be lost that the materials themselves are unintelligible or not trusted even when they can be accessed”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>New contexts for personal archiving</strong><br/>It is interesting to ask ourselves if the paradigms for digital preservation used by librarians and archivists are still valid for preservation of our personal data. Harvey (2012) and Lukesh (1999, cited in Harvey, 2012, p. 32) note that our personal correspondence and sentimental ar- tefacts stored digitally might be lost if we do not take steps to preserve them, and wonder how we will be able to understand our modern life without these exchanges.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Advantages of digital</strong><br/>Kirk and Sellen (2010) found however that ultimately, stories and narrative are more impor- tant than the preservation of the artefact itself. They propose that “technology might play a role in capturing and associating stories or narratives with different physical objects”, imagin- ing we could also digitally augment physical objects or places. Banks (2011) gives as example the Weather Camera (Wilkens, 2011), which records wind force and temperature along with commentary; a system of physicals backup of sentimental items by Serrano (2009) using 3D scanning and 3D printing; and tools by Microsoft Research to recreate an environment in 3D just using photos.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Indexing & cataloguing</strong><br/>The first one, ease of organisation, can be significantly helpful in tackling the abundance of digital data. Banks (2011) suggests that the technologies lying behind the ranking in the result of Web search engines could, eventually, help us in understanding and finding what is our most important data.</p>
</li>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>MUSE example</strong><br/>An attempt has been made by the MUSE (Memories USing Email) project (Hangal et al., 2011), which aims to find patterns in our emails archives to help us make sense of this large data set. As the authors note in the introduction:<br/>
“Email has become a de facto medium of record; many people consciously deposit important information into email, knowing they can look it up later, and thereby use their email account as an informal backup device. Therefore, email archives contain or reflect memories tha...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Copying/backup</strong><br/>The second advantage, the ability to accurately and easily make copies and backups, is fairly obviously an advantage for personal preservation. However, Banks (2011) notes, the process of backing up is troublesome and storage media do not make our data immune. Additionally, the use of online services to store our data creates an abstraction between the storage material and us; about Flickr: “I have no idea what kind of hardware my files are now stored or even where they are geographically. I jus...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Keeping more context</strong><br/>Banks (2011) also suggests that we could blend in the physical and the digital to allow recording of things we never had the opportunity to before. He gives as example the Weather Camera, an experimental object by Kjen Wilkens (2011) that records wind and temperature along with commentary, instead of an image, as an alternative to recall a place; or 3D backups by Héctor Serrano (2009), another experimental project that allows us to make backups of sentimentally important objects through 3D scann...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Pro/cons of archiving everything</strong><br/><br/>
There are various controversies around whether we should automate the archiving of the Internet, or if we should operate a manual selection. UNESCO (2003, p. 73) notes that those who value a more comprehensive collection (i.e. archiving “all” the Internet) argue that “any information may turn out to have long-term value, and that the costs of detailed selection are greater than the costs of collecting and storing everything”. This argument is particularly true because of the digital media: “unl...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Dangers of selection</strong><br/>However, Cook (2000) points out the dangers of manual selection for what is worth archiving: “With memory comes the inevitable privileging of certain records and records creators, and the marginalizing or silencing of others” (Cook, 2000, cited in Harvey p. 58). He asserts that the archivists must be impartial and objective, and ensure all points of view are kept to ensure our shared memory does not “becomes counterfeit, or at least transformed into forgery, manipulation, or imagination”. This i...</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Manual curation</strong><br/>Another interesting selection process that has emerged is the one of specific archiving when certain events are happening. For instance, the UK Web Archive[ukwa] has, on top of their topical-based collections (Energy, Health and Social Care...), a few event-based collections (Queen Jubilee, Olympic and Paralympic Games, London 2005 terrorist attacks...) which reflect the state of the Web at that given moment in history. Masanès (2006, p.83) notes that this type of archiving must be manually cura...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Standardisation</strong><br/>Standardisation is the transformation of a document’s content to a format that is standardised, open and well documented, ensuring that we will be able to open it with a variety of applications on a variety of platforms and that we can rebuild a program for visualising that document — as opposed to vendor-specific, closed source program that could be discontinued at any point in the future. Rothenberg (1999, p. 10)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Migration</strong><br/>Migration is the transformation of a document’s content to a format that is not necessarily standardised, but at least current; or, the newer version of same format. This could be, for example, transferring documents from the WordPerfect 6 format (used in the 80s and late 90s) to a Word 2011 format, or a Word 98 file to Word 2011</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Choosing a method</strong><br/>Thibodeau (2002, pp. 15–16) suggests four criteria to choose a preservation method: feasibility, sustainability, practicality and appropriateness.<br/>
Feasibility means that the hardware and the software for implementing a given method must be existing and developed. Sustainability is ensuring that this method can be “applied indefinitely into the future, or that there are credible grounds for asserting that another path will offer a logical sequel to the method, should it cease being sustainable”. ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Authenticity/integrity</strong><br/>Different preservation methods yield different results in what is called authenticity, that is how faithful the rendition (i.e. the presentation) of the preserved object will be. Authenticity is subjective and therefore there is debate around this issue (Del Pozo et al., 2012, p. 7; Cook, 2000); however most agree that while as little difference in the presentation is desirable, it is rarely (if at all) possible to keep a truthful rendition. As an example, del Pozo et al. (2012, p. 8) use a spre...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Intro</strong><br/>As we have seen, the technical complexity of preserving digital information is a problem in itself. But even once we have chosen a suitable preservation scheme, there is another equally important question that must then be raised: how do we organise and retrieve our data? We cannot simply gather all digital items and let them pile up unorganised. In the context of a digital personal life, several artefacts are created daily (social network updates, emails, messages) and after a decade this can b...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Five orders of magnitude</strong><br/>When organising any type of information, there are generally five ways to do so, known as the five hat racks: by category, by time, by location, alphabetically, and by continuum/magnitude — for example, lowest to highest price, or best to worst result (Wurman, 1989 cited in Lidwell et al., 2010, p. 100; see also Rendgen et al., 2012). In the context of my project, I chose to investigate time exclusively. An alphabetical ordering would be irrelevant since there is a lot of non-textual items on a ...</p>

<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Spatial model of timeline</strong><br/>Most social networks present our post history using a reverse timeline; newer posts at the top, older posts at the bottom. Viewing individual events in chronological order seem like a rational choice. It is however interesting to ask ourselves how do we think about time, in order to understand why this seems rational. Time itself is not a concept that can be visualised. Whenever we think about time, we actually transform it into space in order to picture it in our minds. The most natural way, fo...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Cultural differences</strong><br/>For example, Tversky et al. (1991) demonstrated that the origin of the direction can stem in the reading direction. When we read, the upcoming (future) information is on the right; we make progress by going right in a sentence or book. Speakers of languages that are read from right to left actually think of time going from right to left, the opposite direction of how Western European cultures see it. Participants were asked to put various sets of stickers in the chronological order (for example ...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Circular representation</strong><br/>[Fig. Timelines/Ouroboros]<br/>
This linear timeline, however, is not the only way of representing time; it can also be seen as a recurring cycle. On our day-to-day life, we mostly use this representation for analog clock dials; this is borrowed from sundials, and makes sense when we think of the rotation of the Earth. It really is a continuous cycle, which doesn’t really start nor end happening, but that we can still quantify — a day has passed when a full rotation has been done, and we can map time...</p>

 “However natural it may be to assist the perceptive faculty in its assumption of abstract time by the idea of a line and however inseparable the sensible and mental objects may have become by the figurative method of speech it is astonishing that upon this near advance and with similar assistance from the delicate preciseness of language the image of a Stream should not have presented itself to any one whos...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Process-related</strong><br/>Finally, we can wonder whether trying to represent time is relevant at all. Haynes (2014) encourages us to stop trying to use units, and points out the historical and anthropological works of Sasha Stern and Evans-Pritchard, which respectively analyse the ancient Jews’ and the Nuer’s ways of constructing time in their day-to-day thinking.<br/>
Stern believed that in ancient Judaism, for those speaking Hebrew and Aramaic, “the notion of time as an entity in itself, a human resource, a continuous flow,...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Applying it to a personal life</strong><br/>But should we think using events more than with units? Timelines and mechanical clocks are devices that have appeared relatively recently, over the course of the 18th century (Haynes, 2013a); yet they have shaped our vision of time to be incredibly linear and normalised. But Joseph Priestley, the inventor of the modern history timeline as we know it, admitted this drawback:<br/>
“[…] his innovations posed problems too: historical narrative is not linear. It moves backward and forward making compariso...</p>
