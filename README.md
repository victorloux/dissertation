# Dissertation

Drafts, layout and full copy of my literature review on **Digital Preservation**, and my dissertation called “The long-term backing up of digital memories and design of interfaces to retrieve them” **on the design of timelines for social network archives**.

* [Open final dissertation](https://www.scribd.com/doc/253276496/Dissertation-the-long-term-backing-up-of-digital-memories-and-design-of-interfaces-to-retrieve-them)
* [Open final literature review](LiteratureReview/LiteratureReview-light.pdf)

The literature review and the drafts can be of interest to anyone looking to an introduction or sources into digital preservation; the dissertation can be of interest to designers and data visualisers wanting to represent time.

## Context

Written for the *Research and Creative Practice* module in my 3rd & 4th year of studying Digital Interaction Design at the University of Dundee. The literature review got an A3 and the dissertation got an A2 so I guess they are pretty good examples of a dissertation in interaction design for that module.

I have used Scrivener for the final dissertation, and InDesign for its layout.
